1.4.4a 
a. All the entries, except diagonal entries, in the matrix must have value of 1.
b. The diagonal entries must have value of 1;
c. The adjacent matrix has an all-zero row. 

1.4.4b
a. Each list contains all the vertex
b. The list contains the vertex define the list.
c. Having an empty list.

1.4.9
a. priority queue 
b. queue
c. stacks

1.4.2
a. lists represented as arrays: => we can use binary search
b. lists represented as linked lists: there is not much we can do in this case.

1.4.10
Algorithm:
   
```
Check equal size
    if Yes,
       sorting both word, then compare 
    if No return false
```
